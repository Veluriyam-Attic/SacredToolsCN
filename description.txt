(~~Strikethrough~~ means the bug is fixed for the next patch)

**General**
- Marstech armor spawns more than one aura and thus, more than one shockwave. This causes WAY too much damage on screen and the amount of projectiles could crash your game
- Blazes are broken and don't shoot anything
- Blightbone armor does not affect Bone Glove anymore since it's now an accessory, and the logic still applies to "using" the item, which you cannot do anymore
- ~~Pets show up weirdly on character select~~

**Multiplayer**
- Nihilus arena might kick players out permanently if any respawn mods are loaded

**Tiles**
- Lapis and Bismuth deco tiles can be mined despite not having enough pickaxe power for the ore tiles themselves

**Worldgen**

**Graphics**
- Shadowflare Vortex background breaks when forced minimum zoom setting is enabled (TML bug, dunno if we can fix it)
- It can also sometimes break due to assets not loading correctly, still looking into that (you can temporarily fix this by reloading mods/the game)
- LCS Vanity turns you into NAMELESS DEITY OF LIGHT
- ~~Jensen, Draconic Crusher and Zombie Piglin Bruiser have a missing asset, and will pause the game process until continued when the texture attempts to load~~

**Mod Conflicts**
- ~~Fargo: the thing that causes bosses to drop 5x loot makes Novaniel spawn 5 times (what a surprise return!~~ (Fixed for 1.2.004
- Who would've thought, The Stars Above: Shock and Awe will ***A L S O*** break Nether Portals
- ~~Fargo: Gutted Heart, Pure Heart, and anything else that destroys hostile projectiles on contact causes Nihilus to despawn~~

**Not Bugs**
- Erazor and Nuba are missing (they are somewhere else you can't get to yet)
- Stargazer summons Crimini (not implemented)
- Pseudo-revenant weapons (Throwing weapons that were just changed to Kinetic) cannot get modifiers (because they were not coded to have any)
