	Decorationalist0: Ever heard of a place called Hallownest? I'd really like to go there someday.
	Decorationalist1: Bapanada.
	Decorationalist2: I have enough wares for all your needs.
	Decorationalist3: Don't underestimate nails, they can be quite powerful if used right.
	Decorationalist4: I swear I have seen this place somewhere before...
	Decorationalist5: Wanna take a look at my wares?
	Decorationalist6: This one decoration here, it fits right into your room
	Decorationalist7: This place could use some decorations...
	Decorationalist8: You remind me of someone I know... but who...
	Decorationalist9: Looks like you came for another decoration huh?
	Decorationalist10: Supsies again, want to buy a painting?
	Decorationalist11: Ever turned a sun into a black hole?
	DecorationalistParty: This party is goin' a rockin! All we need now is some of my top tier paintings!
	Erazor0: Being a warrior isn't all about strength; you'll need defense and agility as well to survive in these lands.
	Erazor1: The blood of a true warrior surely flows through your veins.
	Erazor2: When the two crystal guardians along with their homes disappeared from the map, I decided to investigate, and I stumbled across a dimensional rift created by a powerful being. It connects this realm with mine, and that's why I am here.
	Erazor3: Would you consider yourself to be master of this world? If so, what makes you so sure you’ve earned that title?
	Erazor4: Make sure to keep some of the samples for later use, I could make use of the data and create new kinds of weapons using it.
	Erazor5: I can create a multitude of weapons and armor from Asthraltite plating. If you prove to me you’re worth it, I could make you some.
	Erazor6: Those creatures flying around deep below us; In a way, they remind me of my father's warriors.
	Erazor7: Antheé.. my old friend.. I must complete our research...
	Erazor8: Have you talked to Neil yet? I was told there's more erosion spreading around.
	Erazor9: This sword I carry... it is named after my daughter, which I lost in a tragic event approximately 50 years ago. Her name was Yaria.
	Erazor10: I've noted several powerful beings with the telltale signs of an infliction brought on by asthral erosion. If you're feeling risky and want to find some erosion samples, I suppose you could seek them out. As a general rule, the more... magically dynamic places in this world are likely to hold more of these eroded beings.
	ErazorNuba: It is unfortunate that Nuba and her siblings seem to find themselves in trouble so much. I feel... guilty, since I am somewhat responsible for their sorrow.
	ErazorObelisk0: It looks like you are ready young one. Abaddon has already begun with his plans, so get that relic ready and stop him!
	ErazorObelisk1: Make sure to take that relic with you, warrior. It is the only way to break through the defense of these beings.
	ErazorNeedRelic0: The first step is done, but you will need a relic if you want to finish these beings off.
	ErazorNeedRelic1: Without a relic you won't be able to do much harm to these beings.
	ErazorNeedAsthral0: You have bested me, but you are not ready quite yet. You need to train more and acquire a full suit of Asthraltite for your protection.
	ErazorNeedAsthral1: If you want to stop Abaddon's plans you will need Asthraltite armor, it is the only way to withstand the destructive energy created by these beings.
	ErazorDeclineFight:
		'''
		You're too weak to train with me yet, come back when you can stand your ground against eroded beings.

	ErazorStart: Meet me at the courtyard behind the shrine.
	Neil0: I am curious as to how those gills potions of yours work. Do you... actually turn into a fish? at least partially? Is it only the gills part? Or is it like how Syranox breathe underwater?
	Neil1: How high am I? Uh, 6 foot I think
	Neil2: I may be under the effects of a potion... but I'm not ENTIRELY numb, so do me a favor and tell that talking rock behind you to shut up
	Neil3: Ever seen giant red-eyed cyborg chickens around here? Good, thank me for that
	Neil4: Is it liz-ack-hurd or.. lih-zak-ard?
	Neil5: despaircito- wait huh? oh nothing, nothing. Keep going about your day
	Neil6: You probably wonder what I do with all these ingredients huh? Well, I am not sure myself, we don't have those on Syrus. Guess I am just throwing stuff together to see what works haha.
	Neil7: I am not sure if I am hallucinating or not, but earlier I saw some flying eyeballs outside, right after saying hi to the rocket-powered icecream man with oversized jeans
	Neil8: Hey man there's an uhh.... hand on your shoulder- Haha got ya
	Neil9: Ya might think us Sareliants have a hard time with doors, but... dude, that ain't true. Don't believe their lies.
	Neil10: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
	Neil11: Open the door, get on the floor, everybody do the stegosaurus
	Neil12: I checked your reports recently, you spelled 'Abaddon' wrong again. It's one B and two Ds in case you forgot, not 'Abbadon'.
	Neil13: New potion who dis
	Neil14: GAAAA ZING PEW PEW POW BAM BAM BOOM AAAAAAAHHHHH- oh hi.
	Neil15: Does the... number of lines on your healing elixirs actually mean anything? Is there like.. a mathematical equation they correspond to? Is there some kind of authority that enforces labeling potions in your world?
	Neil16: h. hhhh. hhhhhhh. hhhhhhhhhhhh.
	Neil17: They call me the drug machine- No they don't stop lying
	Neil18: I have seven tongues in the back of my head.
	Neil19: Yeah I am currently on a heavy dosage of wednesdays
	Neil20: I studied alchemy in the highest academy on Syrus, so I can get a drink whenever I feel like it.
	Neil21: No I am not high, you are high! How did you even get into my room?
	Neil22: Y'know, despite how potent my Mix is, the burning memories of my days at the academy keep resurfacing. Perhaps I'll never find a way to block them out. Perhaps I shouldn't...
	Neil23: My hair? Oh yeah it's a scythe. Can you guys not shape your hair the way you want?
	Neil24: F to my mans hair noodle cherry boi
	Neil25: *Poses menacingly*

	NeilErosionUGHallow: Looks like rainbow land got down with the sickness, there's some Erosion to weed out.
	NeilErosionUGEvil: Purple eyeballs... Purple teeth... purple flesh... ew. Make it a little less disgusting by getting rid of whatever caught the Erosion.
	NeilErosionSky: No. There's nothing up there. Stop.
	NeilErosionUGDesert: There's reports of deafening screams down in the desert caves, as well as latent eroded energy. Go investigate.
	NeilErosionFRF: Y'know, dude, I always loved the Cinder Forest. Unfortunate that due to these unforseen events, the Erosion managed to plague its creatures. Go put them out of their misery.
	NeilErosionHell: Whatever those mockeries of our kind down there are, they seem to not care for what they come across and inevitably got themselves eroded. Obliterate them.
	NeilErosionUnknown: my dude, my man, my head honcho extraordinaire, i don't even know anymore
	Pandolar0: IT'S TIME FOR A TEA PARTYYY!
	Pandolar1: Ariketik is a place that's very hostile for life to develop, it only really hosts us Olaar and the feared Anudeya C'thyr and Uleru. There might be other species, but the constant blizzards and fog make it hard to really find anything.
	Pandolar2: You got some spare ice blocks? It’s really hot right now...
	Pandolar3: My old home looked way better than this.
	Pandolar4: Sometimes I think about licking ice cubes...
	Pandolar5: Got something to trade?
	Pandolar6: Need something??
	Pandolar7: Glad I got this thermal flow augmented armor, without these Cernium crystals I'd be melting.
	Pandolar8: It smells like burning, have you dropped into a volcano or something?
	Pandolar9: There's a myth about humans turning into mutants after bathing in the blood of monsters, lets hope you don't end that way as well.
	Pandolar10: Danim Zedonibēùs
	Pandolar11: I have a multitude of furs. If you got that muney
	Pandolar12: Je lowù all teshat bomus
	Pandolar13: Pandas? Oh I know about them. I was told that's what the term "Pandolar" is based off of. Personally, I prefer to refer to our kin in our native tongue, which would be 'Olaar'.
	Pandolar14: Arguuth doing alright?
	Pandolar15: You look... tired. Stop it. Get some help.
	PandolarNuba: It's nice to see Nuba has finally accepted that there is yet no way to bring their father back, she'll help us a lot in trying to find a way back to Syrus.
	PandolarPreSiblings: Novaniel and his siblings, the lost siblings and children of Nahlaár. I see that they have fallen into the rift as well. Not sure what they are up to here, but it seems to have to do with this world's moon.
	PandolarPreAraghur: Along with me a couple other people from Syrus were thrown into the rift. We should find them to figure out how to return
	PandolarPreAbaddon: I was about to return to Ariketik, to bring back the captured Decree, when suddenly the sky above Syrus turned dark and I found myself in a strange world, I was not able to land in time and crashed into the tundra
	PandolarParty: Parties are great. Balloons, blinking lights, music... the only thing that it’s missing is a giant ice statue.
	PandolarEnhancement: Claymarine Enhancement
	PandolarSalvageButton: Salvaged Items
	PandolarSalvageCooldown: I didn't find anything interesting yet. Come back later; maybe I'll have something by then...
	PandolarSalvageMysteriousGem: Here, take this, I have found this on my journey here and have no use for it. Maybe it will come in handy?
	PandolarSalvageStandard: Oh man... it feels so nice to get my hands on some of this fur. The raw magic power from it is bursting at the seams... Also, they hunt us on our home planet for our magical potential. It seems the prey has become the predator! In fact, why don't you take some? I can't possibly use all of it.
	PandolarSalvageGems: I went on a mining trip earlier today, found some things that might be useful to you. Here, take these.
	PandolarSalvageCorruption: It's interesting how the great corrupted worm is entirely made up of demonite and shadow scales. Speaking of them, take some you missed!
	PandolarSalvageCrimson: Those creepers which circle the brain live up to their name! Take the tissue samples and crimtane you left, I don't want to be reminded of them!
	PandolarSalvageDungeon: I recognised some of those skeletons... they were merchants I stol- uh I mean bought from! Take some bones you dropped down there.
	PandolarSalvageWax: While researching the jungle hives, I found some bee wax from a totally destroyed hive. On the way back, I dropped by a pumpkin patch and snagged a couple. Maybe they'll bee of use to you?
	PandolarSalvageHM: I decided to go spelunking after the guide was killed. Man, I'm not sure what you did down there, but things just got a lot harder! Here are some of my findings from down there.
	PandolarSalvageMech: I noticed some scrap metal that fell off those mechanical creatures you fought earlier. Don't be deceived by our love of cold, us Pandolars are great blacksmiths!
	PandolarSalvageRaynare: After your battle with the Harpy Queen, feathers were scattered EVRYWHERE. I think I may have even found some of Jensen's lying in there too...
	PandolarSalvageLihzahrd: I dropped by the jungle temple earlier, and found some fragments of some sort of tablet along with a couple loose bricks. The bricks almost look like they could be used in some sort of bar...
	PandolarSalvageTide: When I explored the ocean, I found a huge fish, and it was dead as usual. When I went to see what i could get out of it, I found a huge abundance of souls just sitting in it. I think you'd have more of a use for them than I do.
	PandolarSalvageCelestial: Man, that was a lot of celestial aliens. I think they come from this world's moon well, anyways, I managed to salvage a few fragments that I think you missed.
	PandolarSalvageOblivion: After you defeated Abaddon, all those nightmares of being on the sun went away! I'm shivering just thinking about it... however, I did dream about a specific location underground. When I went there, I found some of this ore. Take some of it, I don't have an inkling on what it's for.
	PandolarSalvageFlarium: I visited the Infernal Depths after you defeated Araghur, and managed to collect some samples while I was there. Maybe they could be of use to you?
	PandolarSalvageLunarCoins: I spoke to Nuba earlier, and I mast say, the civilization of Soran seems quite interesting! She thanked me for having a conversation with her, and gave me these coins. She said they're a special currency on Soran. I have no use for them, so you should take them.
	PandolarWake: How many years have passed? None? 1000? 400,000? Oh, excuse me, my name is {0}, thank you for saving me. Is there any way I can help you?
	PandolarHaunt: Turn off autopause or I will haunt your dreams.
	Ralnek0: I didn't ask to be here, I hope we can get back home soon...
	Ralnek1: This place is too cold for me, and I don't like it.
	Ralnek2: Got some gold? None of that basic stuff, I am looking for a special kind.
	Ralnek3: I may be a coward oftentimes, but when I must I will give my all in battle!
	Ralnek4: I wonder if master Araghur is okay. I can feel his presence but his voice cannot be heard...
	Scavenger0: I’ve seen quite a lot of beasties in my days, I’ve even seen a phantom hauntin’ over at the billabong!
	Scavenger1: What? You think I’m over ‘ere pokin’ swords in beastie tickers? Naw cobber, I’m just waltzin’ over here, takin’ the swag you left behind!
	Scavenger2: G’day mate! I’m {0}, your dardy ol’ cobber! Be sure to purchase my shmickin’ wares, you’ll get me mate’s rate!
	Scavenger3: Over in oz we got the craziest stuff! Heard of a kanga? A cockie? Maybe even a dingie? You should come over ‘ere sometime, everyone’s a bit of a galah here!
	Scavenger4: What’s all this about ‘straya not existin’? What a buncha bush pigs! I was born n’ raised down under, ‘course it exists! Must have a bit of the ol’ kangaroos in the top paddock!
	Scavenger5: Seen any jumbucks lately? What a buncha cheeky menaces they are! Escapin’ their masters then gettin’ swaggies drowned in billabongs!
	Scavenger6: Don’t ye love chrissie? Glorious time of fun, unrule tucker to bog into and best of all prezzies! Must be nice havin’ that white stuff fallin’ on yer heads! Never seen it in me life!
	ScavengerDesert: It’s just like home over ‘ere!
	ScavengerSnow: Wow, the ground is white! Wow, the ground is falling on our heads! Wow, how does everyone not find this amazing?
	ScavengerFRF: I won’t lie cobber, this is just like home over ‘ere.
	ScavengerBloodMoon: Can’t yer see that I’m workin’ my soul case out, I’m bloody well tired, so bugger off ya nillwit!
	ScavengerDecree: Ah cobber, the Decree, the beastie of the tundras, the once wee little canine in a two men and one dog to the monster that bogs into the Pandolars for their bonza magic. Glad it carked it, yer the best thing since sliced bread!
	ScavengerRalnek: ‘Avin a blue with a pumpkin is like ‘avin a blue with a wall, unless it’s the smokin’ hot burning horror of the night! I wonder ‘ow such a wee lil’ object could become such a scorchin’ beast!
	ScavengerJensen: ‘eard of Winterfloat? Lovely ol’ place that is. Speakin’ of Winterfloat, that green feathered cockie-sheila like thing you had a bit of a blue with is the princess of Winterfloat! I’m sure that ranga queen won’t be too much of a happy little vegemite about that.
	ScavengerAraneas: Crikey, the great spider nest of the deep ends! Nasty ol’ place that is, even worse than straya’s cranky ol’ spiders! Their empress is like gettin’ into a blue with one of em bird boggin’ spiders! It’s like every man and his dog in there! All me myself can really say about em is that we’re not ‘ere to heck spiders!
	ScavengerRaynare: Seems like that ol’ ragna queen of Winterfloat isn’t much of a grand ol’ sheila now. After losin’ that blue with ye, not even a blotto bloke has any faith in her! ‘Gratulations for the collapse of a bonza empire, I s’pose.
	ScavengerPrimordia: L I Z A R D S
	ScavengerAbaddon: Ah ye, Abaddon! Emissary of Nightmares! Demonic Shadow Wraith of when y’all are havin’ a nanna’s! Do the bee’s knees to watch out for him, he’s the last one you’d want to have a blue with!
	ScavengerAraghur: That snake hips settle petal ol’ magma serpent? That’d most certainly be the old cobber Araghur, the Flare Serpent! Quite the chap he is, more than just a cute ol’ serpent with a temper bad enough to gag a maggot! Maybe he’ll decide to move here one day!
	ScavengerSiblings: That ol’ Nuba sheila you fought was quite the good sort, sweet Aussie accent! That Voxa sheila though, she got a bit of a face of a smashed crab, sheepshagger at that!
	ScavengerErazor: E R A Z O R   I S   H A N D S O M E
	ScavengerMale: "{0} is it? My oh my, what a fine ol’ bloke you are! Ye seem like kind of a cruiseling and as cool as a cucumber!"
	ScavengerFemale: Well you’re a fine lookin’ sheila {0}! You’re the good sort, got a sweet ol’ personality as well!
	ScavengerMistake: Tell me your secrets
	Nuba0: Thank you for letting me stay here, I needed to go somewhere and I must say, this is a lovely place.
	Nuba1: Must say, the people where I'm from aren't exactly the nicest people. I much prefer it here, thank you.
	Nuba2: You know, somehow I feel like that giant lunar beast wasn't our father. His aura feels similar however it is also a little different, not sure if Novaniel feels that difference too...
	Nuba3: We never got those annoying slimes on Soran, they're such a bunch of cheeky menaces!
	Nuba4: I got some pretty nice things to sell, they're totally out of this world!
	Nuba5: What exactly do you people call yourself? Would 'Terrarian' work?
	Nuba6: Is there... actually something beyond the oceans? I've been at the beach quite a few times and I can only see water.
	Nuba7: "'My wares are out of this world!' Like my catchphrase? No? Oh..."
	Nuba8: I keep on getting these weird messages from people such as 'you're hot' and 'nuba best girl', I must say that this definitely makes me feel like you people really are that evil...
	Nuba9: Oh dear, mutants! They scare me, they look an amalgamation of all those creatures they've killed! Not that us Soraniti are much better, I must say...
	Nuba10: Oh, so you're {0}? Uh, yeah! Hi! Nice to erm, meet you!
	NubaGuide: This is a strange world you live in, {0} has been telling me a lot about it, it seems to be similar to our homeworld Soran, however it is not a moon but an actual planet, just like Syrus.
	NubaPandolar: I hope {0} doesn't mind my presence, me and my siblings are infamous for disobeying the Elite Guardians' orders to not visit Soran multiple times and conducting forbidden research with Asthraltite.
	NubaNovanielPresent: I knew Novaniel would come back! I must say, I did miss him. I'm glad he made the decision to join us, he was the one we all looked up to, the fabled prince of Soran.
	NubaNovanielAbsent: When I left my home, my eldest brother was filled with sadness. He said we'd meet again another day, maybe he'll even come here.

		Certain stats will now have Diminishing Returns, losing effectiveness as you stack the specific stat:
		   - Melee speed
		   - Crit chance
		You will be able to counter negative effects and build into new stats:
		   - Boss Damage: Increased damage against bosses
		   - Polarize: Increases damage dealt and received (subject to diminishing returns)
		   - Accuracy: Counters the effects of Damage falloff (subject to diminishing returns)
		   - Crit Damage: Increases the damage of critical strikes

		Bosses will drop new rewards, including Glass Hearts and Challenge Items:
		   - Glass Hearts are obtained by defeating specific post Moon-Lord bosses with any Glass Soul active, and will increase your max health
		   - Challenge Items are obtained by defeating bosses under certain conditions, with hints displayed in the Bestiary. You can equip them in their designated slot

		This item persists after use, so you can read up on the mechanics when you need to.
