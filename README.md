**- - The Kara System - -**
``` 
Main location of the story, contains the planet Syrus and its moons Soran and Aron, and the planet Phyron with its moon Thanatos, and a asteroid belt and various unnamed dwarf planets containing mineral deposits which are harvested by the Syrusians when in need of raw metal.

Kara is a star roughly the same age as Sol, but has a longer lifetime.
It is a normal yellow star with roughly the same conditions as the sun, when its system was created, there was not enough mass for more bigger sized planets to form, and thus only 2 planets within the goldilocks zone were created, the rest of the material turning into an asteroid belt and several small dwarf planets outside of the habitable zone.

As this is a star, there is no known lifeform on it and known lifeforms are unable to survive its extreme conditions, this is obviously different for the planets orbiting the star.
```
**- - Syrus - -**<br>
```
One of the two habitable planets in the Kara system, most of the main story happens here, it has roughly 1.3 times the size of earth, but the smaller core causes the gravity to be roughly the same. 
It has way more continents than Earth, because it got most of the materials that were created at the birth of the star system.
Each continent counts as one region/nation and contain several different species.
Syrus owns 2 moons, Soran and Aron.
While Soran is habitable due to having a liquid core and oceans, Aron is a desolate wasteland, but filled to the brim with minerals.

**- - Information about the different regions: - -**<br>
*Nextaria*<br>
```
Crescent-shaped mainland with a oval-shaped island roughly in the middle between the two crescent edges, this island is the "Guardians' Island" and is the location of the Elite Guardians' main base, here they prepare for missions and train new soldiers to help defend the planet against potential enemies and also for exploring new worlds and finding possible allies.
This region is mostly known for its strong connection to energy and the spirits, it is also where the spirit trees grow and originally came from.
Its capital is Welther, which consists of 3 districts.
```
*Auraliz*<br>
```
The region of flora and fauna, this place is filled with all kinds of plant and animal life and consists mostly of forests and jungles, it is also where most the elves on Syrus live.
The elves form tribes and live in the depths of the forests. Each tribe has their own leader and fights with their own style, protecting the nature around them and their leaders with their lifes.
Most elf children are told that there is nothing outside of the forest, to keep them safe. When they are older and ready to defend themselves, they are told that there is a world outside of Auraliz, and they are free to do what their heart tells them.
```
*Perelia*<br>
```
This is a place which one could call the surface equivalent of hell.
Only inhabited by fire spirits and heat resistant lifeforms, this place is constantly ablaze.
Once a world of forests and green grass, this place was cursed to burn for all eternity when the Sareliant War was raging.
The curse remains unbroken, unknown where the origin of the flame lies, no one attempted it. 
This region is mostly avoided by travellers and the higher powers, though they sometimes venture through the burning hell in search of fire resistant metal that could be used as a cheap alternative to Magamantez' Draconium.
```
*Aeres*<br>
```
A floating island held up in the air by a giant wind crystal.
At the times of the Vampyranox War, the Yura and Demi-Yura were hiding on Aeres, but it was not for long until they were found.
It looked like their species would be eradicated from the planet, but one talented sorcerer was able to use wind crystal fusion to create a giant wind crystal powerful enough to channel the winds of the surrounding area and lift the island into the sky, surrounding it with a protective shield of raging storms only a dragon could pass through. But the sorcerer had to pay a high price, the fusion caused him to be fused with the crystal mass aswell. Today he is known as the protector of Aeres, Lumen Rah. A tower was constructed above the cave where the crystal resides, to protect it in case that someone would get through the storms and attack.
This region is known for its high tech and for wind magic, it is inhabited by Yura, Demi-Yura and Wyverns.
It is the smallest region of them all, as it is only one island, and only has about 3 big cities with one of them being the capital, Aerola City, which houses the tower.
```
*Ameya*<br>
```
A group of 5 islands, surrounded by shallow waters filled with underwater buildings, this place is where most of the Syranox reside.
The capital of this region is on the biggest of the 5 islands; Florasia, and is called Crystallea, named after the Syranox Queen Crystal.
The city is fueled by the power of water, it is filled with a lot of waterways and artificial lakes.
The Prism Temple, the residence of queen Crystal, is submerged underwater and in the center of the city, connected with all of the waterways. You have to be a Syranox to enter the temple or atleast know how to swim, the inside of the temple is not flooded.
There is not much historical information known about Ameya, other than that it was the birthplace of the Syranox species, and the place where the Vampyranox war began.
```
*Draconia*<br>
```
As the name suggests, this is a region that has to do with dragons. It is mostly an empty, flat region with a few mountains that act as the resting places for the few dragons that survived the wars that raged on the planet. The main island is surrounded by a ring of smaller islands formed by volcanic activities. There is no capital here and neither are there any big cities, only a few small villages. 
Entry into this region is forbidden as it counts as sacred ground and must be protected. It acts as the resting and breeding grounds for the leftover dragons on this world, and to keep the species from going extinct, the region remains empty to allow the dragon species to rise anew, without being bothered by anyone.
```
*Lehrias*<br>
```
A toxic swamp, that's basically all there is to say about this region.
It has no capital, cities consist of small settlements that change their location and wander off to new places every once in a while.
Inhabitants of these lands are lamia, serpentines and other reptilian species.
Half of the region's area is filled with a thick green fog, the mistlands, which is inhabited by strange creatures that hunt for prey in the fog, caution is to be taken when venturing in this area.
```
*Terena*<br>
```
A rocky, mountainous region, inhabited mostly by the Daigaru species, which live in underground cities within mountains.
This place contains some of the highest mountains on Syrus, most of them being in the mountain range called the Granite Mountains, gray in color with blue granite veins.
On sea level the region has a lot of grasslands, lakes, rivers, and at the south coast there are the clay and gravel fields, desert-like areas filled purely with that material.
Snow does not appear in this area up until the very top of the granite mountains, though no one lives up there, except harpies. Most life settled either in or on the mountains or in the grasslands at sea level.
The capital of this region is Gerfola and is located at the north-west corner of the continent at sea level, within the grasslands.
